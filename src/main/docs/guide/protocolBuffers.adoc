This project also includes a module that adds the ability to encode and decode Protocol buffers messages with the Micronaut HTTP server.

To use this adds the `micronaut-protobuff-support` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-protobuff-support[groupId="io.micronaut.grpc"]

Micronaut will now support the encoding and decoding requests / responses of type `application/x-protobuf`.
