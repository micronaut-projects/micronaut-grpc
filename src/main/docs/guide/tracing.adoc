gRPC includes tracing based on OpenCensus, however if you wish to use Micronaut's integration with Jaeger or Zipkin you can do so by adding the following dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-tracing[scope="compile"]

dependency:opentracing-grpc[scope="runtime", version="0.2.1", groupId="io.opentracing.contrib"]

You then need to https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#distributedTracing[configure either Jaeger or Zipkin] appropriately.
