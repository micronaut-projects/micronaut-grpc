gRPC includes tracing based on OpenCensus, however if you wish to use Micronaut's integration with Jaeger or Zipkin you can do so by adding the following dependencies:

dependency:micronaut-tracing-brave-http[scope="compile", groupId="io.micronaut.tracing"]

dependency:opentracing-grpc[scope="runtime", version="0.2.1", groupId="io.opentracing.contrib"]

You then need to https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-tracing/latest/guide/#jaeger[configure either Jaeger or Zipkin] appropriately.
